      <h1>Prediction: <strong class=warning>Severe Risk</strong></h1>
      <h2>The model predicts that you may be at <strong class=warning>severe risk for depression.</strong></h2>
      <p>However, please remember that mental health diagnosis is a <strong><em>process</em></strong> that requires a comprehensive assessment by qualified professionals.
        The predictions generated by this model are merely probabilistic and should <strong class=important>never be used to substitute a diagnosis.</strong></p>
      <p>It is highly recommended that you seek a formal diagnosis from a healthcare provider. Your symptoms may be having a major impact on your relationships and daily life,
        so it is crucial to get the support you need.</p>
      <p>If you are experiencing a crisis, please call or text the National Crisis Lifeline at 988.</p>
